The primary purpose of an assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, assessments help you establish which topics you have mastered and which require further focus before completing the course. Ultimately, the assessment is designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned. This assessment's learning objective is to allow you to create a user interface using SwiftUI.
